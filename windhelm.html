  <h1>Windhelm (Unsent) – To the Man Who Would Claim Skyrim</h1>
  
<p>I stood on your walls, once. The banners snapped in the wind. Your people were hungry. Proud. Bitter. And hopeful in a way I had not seen in a long time.</p>
<p>But you were chasing ghosts. A Skyrim that never truly existed. A throne not empty, but abandoned by the will of the people who were tired of bleeding for it.</p>
<p>I never sent this letter. You would not have listened. But I hope, in some other life, you found peace not in conquest—but in understanding.</p>
