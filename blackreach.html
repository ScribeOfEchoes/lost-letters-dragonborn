  <h1>Blackreach – Looking for Something</h1>
  
<p>I came here chasing power. What I found was silence.</p>
<p>Not the peaceful kind. The heavy kind. The kind that feels like a thousand eyes waiting to open. This place remembers things no one asked it to.</p>
<p>If you're reading this, you came for something, too. Just don’t stay too long. Some doors aren’t meant to be opened. And some echoes answer back.</p>
