  <h1>Riften – To the One Watching the Vault</h1>
  
<p>The Guild you joined was not the one I found. Ours was a breath away from death, strangled beneath Maven’s heel, drowned in debt and dust.</p>
<p>But the shadow never dies, not truly. It waits. Sometimes that’s all survival is—waiting long enough for the world to forget how it beat you.</p>
<p>If you seek fortune, take it. If you seek silence, make it. But never forget: the price of freedom is knowing when to run, and when to disappear.</p>
