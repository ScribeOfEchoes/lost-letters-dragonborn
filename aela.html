  <h1>Jorrvaskr – To Aela</h1>
  
<p>I didn’t come looking for family. But that’s what I found. A broken one, worn by time and teeth, howling at the moon not out of purpose—but pain.</p>
<p>You were never afraid of what you were. That strength terrified me. Not because it was wild—but because it was true. You knew the beast, named it, and walked beside it without flinching.</p>
<p>I loved you. I never said it the way I should have. But every step beside you was the only time I didn’t feel like a god, or a symbol, or a lie. Just a shield-brother.</p>
<p>If I don’t return to Jorrvaskr, know that some part of me still runs the plains, just behind you, where I belong.</p>
