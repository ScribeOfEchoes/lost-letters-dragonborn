  <h1>Sky Haven Temple – To the One Who Carries the Oath</h1>
  
<p>The Blades asked me to kill a dragon. Not just any dragon—one who had turned away from fire. One who had learned mercy.</p>
<p>I could not do it. Not because I doubted his past, but because I saw it mirrored in mine. We are not born good. We are not born wise. We choose, again and again, to be more than what we were.</p>
<p>If the oath binds you to obedience, break it. If it binds you to honor, uphold it. But let no one demand that you forget what you learned simply because it makes them afraid.</p>
