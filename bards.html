  <h1>Bards College – To the Ones Who Turn Blood into Ballads</h1>
  
<p>I used to think the sword was louder than the song. That what mattered was who lived and who died, not who remembered.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Stories survive where kingdoms fall. Songs cross borders even when blades cannot. You will do more for peace than I ever did with my shout.</p>
<p>Keep singing. Even when the halls are empty. Especially then.</p>
