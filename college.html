  <h1>College of Winterhold – To the One Who Studies Alone</h1>
  <p>The College stood quiet when I arrived, its name carried more by memory than merit. Winterhold was half-buried beneath the sea. Magic was feared like fire. Few dared its halls.</p>
  <p>Yet there you were—still learning. That was reason enough for me to stay.</p>
