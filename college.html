  <h1>College of Winterhold – To the One Who Studies Alone</h1>
  
<p>The College was already fading when I arrived. No lectures. No legacy. Just a shell clinging to a cliffside and a whisper of power held behind locked doors.</p>
<p>And yet, you remained. Practicing, reading, failing, trying again. Magic is a dangerous thing. But so is purpose. You had both. That made you more a mage than most Arch-Mages I ever met.</p>
<p>The world will always fear what it does not understand. You do not owe it your obedience—but perhaps you owe it your patience.</p>
<p>Hold fast. The sea does not stop for one voice. But it remembers the stone that held through the tide.</p>
