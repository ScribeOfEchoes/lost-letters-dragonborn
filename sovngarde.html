  <h1>Sovngarde – The Dragonborn’s Echo</h1>
  
<p>They welcomed me like a brother. Heroes of old. I should have felt honored. But I looked around and realized: this is a tomb of victories. A hall of endings.</p>
<p>Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I never did.</p>
<p>But I did what had to be done. Alduin is no more. The world lives on. And if that means I never see this place again, that’s a price I pay gladly.</p>
