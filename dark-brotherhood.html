  <h1>Dawnstar Sanctuary – To the One Still Listening</h1>
  
<p>I was not trained in the old ways. I did not hear the Black Hand’s voice or kneel at a full sanctuary. I found a corpse, a whisper, and a broken promise—and from that, I made something terrible and small.</p>
<p>But the Night Mother whispered, still. Even if it was only to me.</p>
<p>We are not what we were. Maybe we never were. But if the blade still finds the throat in silence, if the name is still spoken in dread, then some piece of our shadow survives.</p>
