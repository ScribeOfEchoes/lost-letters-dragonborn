# Lost Letters of the Dragonborn

> *"They say the Dragonborn vanished. Some say they walked into Sovngarde alive. Others say they climbed the Throat of the World and never came down. But what’s left behind are these—quiet scraps of memory, found in old ruins, forgotten sanctuaries, and hollowed halls. Not declarations. Not triumphs. Just letters. And perhaps, something like truth."*

**Lost Letters of the Dragonborn** is a fictional Elder Scrolls lore project—an anthology of introspective, in-universe letters written by the Last Dragonborn near the end of their journey. These are not heroic boasts, but private reflections: meditations on power, silence, failure, and legacy. 

Each letter is “discovered” in a meaningful location—be it the depths of Blackreach, the shrine of a forgotten god, or beneath the banner of a ruined guild. Together, they form a kind of spiritual epilogue to *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*.
